### Mathematican in Finance, Data Scientist, Gamer

Hi! I'm Marius. I am studied Mathematics & Economics and started my career in Finance.
My current focus lies in Time Series Forecasting, which I think is - in the times of big neural nets - a dying field!

I write code since my early study days, where I started with Pascal, C++, Matlab, R and Python.
I stuck with the last two, even though I almost default to Python entirely nowadays.

My three most loved hobbies are asian cusine, weight lifting and gaming.
